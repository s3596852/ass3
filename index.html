									The aims of our project is to create an app which can replace our myki card. 

									 Bus Train and Tram inquiry, the information of the bus shuttle, trains and trams can be quickly and accurately queried. The user only needs to input the stop name to obtain the current latest data of the current transport presented by the platform for the user, the bus arrival time is clear at a glance, and the time error is also very small.

									 City positioning, the APP of the map class will have a function. The purpose of the city positioning is to better obtain the public transportation information for the user.

									 Online recharge => What if the traffic card balance is insufficient? The answer is to directly recharge through the online APP. The APP is connected to your bank account. 

									 Replenishment card, report loss.The system sets up functions such as loss of traffic card and replacement card for the user. The user can directly apply for the replacement or loss of the traffic card online.

									 Route inquiry, users want to get to the destination quickly, just need to enter the place where the app is located and where you want to go, you can quickly get the most realistic route plan.
